# Nanomsg Organization Governance

## BDFL

The nanomsg organization is govered by a leader who we refer
to as the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life).  This person,
Garrett D'Amore <garrett@damore.org>, is responsible for providing
technical oversight and leadership to the project.

As indicated, this is a dictatorship.  Our belief is that strong
leadership is required to ensure the direction of the project,
and that governance by consensus is not an effective way for the
project to continue to evolve and grow to the meet needs of its users.

The BDFL has the ability to change, or act in contravention to, any
of the policies outlined here, within the limits imposed by law.

The purpose of *this* document is to communicate the principles by
which the BDFL, at least at the time he wrote this, intends to lead.

## The Right to Fork

The software developed by the nanomsg organization is all to be done
under open source licenses.  Thus, if at any time, any party or parties
wish to fork the project and start their own, they may of course do so.
They may not however use the nanomsg name, or any of the other trademarks
associated with nanomsg or individual community members, without the
express permission of the owners of those marks.

## Leadership Council

In order to advise the BDFL, a leadership council will be formed of
members of the community who are believed to represent the interests
of the community.  Its members serve at the pleasure of the BDFL, but
nominations shall be considered from the community at large.

It is possible that some of these seats will be filled democratically,
using an election process to be determined, however ultimately subject
to approval by the BDFL.

The leadership council has powers and responsibilities granted to it
by the BDFL.

It is expected that the leadership council will meet at some periodic
interval.

It is expected that the council will consist of at least 3, and not more
than 7, members.

## Succession

Nobody lives forever, not even BDFLs.

In the event that the BDFL becomes deceased, or legally declared incompetent
(following the laws of his state of residence, California), it is his
intent that the Leadership Council shall take over his duties and run the
project by a simple majority rule, excepting that any action that runs
in contravention to the principles set forth herein, or to change such
principles of leadership, shall require a 2/3
majority of all council members to approve.

Further, in the event that the BDFL is no longer able to serve, having
been deceased or become legally incompetent, the then serving Leadership
Council may unanimously elect a new BDFL, who will then obtain all the
rights associated with BDFL.

A BDFL may willing abdicate, in writing.  In such case, it shall be treated
as if he had become deceased.

As with everything else, the BDFL may change these rules of succession
at any time, including by naming a successor.

## Code of Conduct

As a community organization, it is important that we conduct ourselves
in a manner that is welcoming and respectful of others.

Accordingly, we have adopted a Code of Conduct.  The BDFL is the
sole enforcer of the code, and may take actions as he sees necessary
in such enforcement for the good of the community.

There is no recourse, other than the Right to Fork, in the even that the
BDFL himself is found to have violated the Code of Conduct.

The BDFL however states that he intends to conduct himself in accordance
with the Code of Conduct.
